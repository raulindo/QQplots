# QQplots

This is a very straightforward way to plot QQ plots in matplotlib given some data. A function which calculate the quantiles given any numerical object, such as lists, pandas series or numpy arrays and returns 100 quantiles. 
It should be used with two objects that will be compared against. 

**See the Jupyter Notebook for better understanding of the code!**
